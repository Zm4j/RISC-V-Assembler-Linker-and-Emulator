# **RISC-V Assembler, Linker, and Emulator**

A complete **RISC-V software toolchain** implemented in **C++**, consisting of an **assembler**, **linker**, and **emulator**.  <br>
This project provides an end-to-end environment for assembling, linking, and executing RISC-V assembly programs with support for relocatable and executable output formats. <br>
the project was carried out in conjunction with the Faculty of Electrical Engineering in Belgrade, as an optional project part of the System Software course for the school year 2024/2025. <br>

- Files starting with **a_** belong to the **assembler**.  
- Files starting with **l_** belong to the **linker**.  
- Files starting with **e_** belong to the **emulator**.

## ⚙️ **Build System**

The project uses a single **Makefile** with four main build targets:

|         Command         |          Description         |
|-------------------------|------------------------------|
| `make build_asembler`   | Builds only the assembler.   |
| `make build_linker`     | Builds only the linker.      |
| `make build_emulator`   | Builds only the emulator.    |
| `make build_all`        | Builds all three components. |

All compiled outputs are placed in the **root directory** as separate executables:  
`./asembler`, `./linker`, and `./emulator`.

## 🧱 **Components Overview**

### **Assembler**
Translates RISC-V assembly code into relocatable object files using **Flex** and **Bison**.  
Each source file is processed into an intermediate representation containing symbol tables, sections, and relocation data.

**Usage:**
```bash
./asembler [-o output_file] input_file
Options:
  -o output_file             — specifies the output file name.
```

### **Linker**
Combines multiple object files produced by the assembler into a single executable or relocatable file.
Performs symbol resolution, relocation, and section placement based on provided flags.

**Usage:**
```bash
./linker [-o output_file] [-hex] [-relocatable] [-place=section@address] input_file1, input_file2, ...

Options:
  -o output_file             — name of the output file.
  -hex                       — generates a hexadecimal memory image executable by the emulator.
  -relocatable               — produces a relocatable archive (like a library).
  -place=section@address     — assigns a custom starting address to a specific section (only valid with -hex).
```

### **Emulator**
Simulates a simplified RISC-V processor that executes machine code generated by the linker.
Implements memory, registers, stack, interrupt handling, and instruction decoding.

**Usage**
```bash
./emulator input_file
```

## 🏗️ **Build and Run Example**

```bash
# Build all components
make build_all

# Assemble source code
./asembler -o file1.o program1.s
./asembler -o file2.o program2.s

# Link object files into executable hex
./linker -o final.hex -hex file1.o file2.o -place=code@0x40000000

# Run program in emulator
./emulator final.hex
```

## 💡 **Notes**

- The build/ folder is automatically generated during compilation and contains temporary build files.
- The toolchain supports modular extension, allowing future additions such as new instruction types or section attributes.
- Designed for educational purposes and experimentation with RISC-V architecture and low-level systems concepts.
- More details about project are given inside .pdf file that is text of project that is done here for C level (project is in Serbian)

## ⚙️ **Requirements**

To build and run the project, ensure the following tools are installed:

- g++ (C++17 or later)
- make
- flex
- bison
- pthread (for threading support)
